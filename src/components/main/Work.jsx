              I've been at UBS for a little over a year and a half now. During
              my first year, I was working on an Equities Order Management
              System within the Investment Bank. Recently, I have moved over to
              the Wealth Management Division where I have rekindled with my
              excitement of working on the front-end side of applications.

              Outside of work you'll find me spending quality time with friends
              & family, cooking all the delicious recipes I find on the internet
              and getting better at pushing, picking up and squatting heavy
              things.
